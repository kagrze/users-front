users-front
===

A simple REST client written in [AngularJS 1.x](https://angularjs.org/) that demonstrates use of [$resource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource) and a few other Angular services.

It is based on [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) and is also inspired by [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat).

It requires [users-back](https://github.com/kagrze/users-back) back-end to run properly.

The project is build with [Bower](http://bower.io/) package manager. You can test it with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Just type `npm start` and then go to [http://localhost:8000/app](http://localhost:8000/app).
